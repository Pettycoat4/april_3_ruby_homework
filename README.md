Hi Dan - So, I couldn't really figure out how to do this only using what we worked on in the class lesson. 
I am not sure that I did it the best way, in fact I would bet my paycheck that I did it in a really annoying way lol. 
If there was a better way to do this, please let me know :) 

I will work on the bonus assignment listed in the lesson outline this week.



Thanks!
Christina
